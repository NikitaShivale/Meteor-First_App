# About Meteor:

-	Meteor is a JavaScript based environment to run web and mobile applications.  1.10.2 is the latest version of Meteor. 
-	One of the most important features of Meteor is that its server is available for the clients as well. 
-	Meteor comes with default frontend framework of its own called ‘Blaze’. This can be removed and other framework of our choice such as Angular, React, Vue etc. can be setup. 
-	Mongodb is the default database used by Meteor that cannot be changed (One of the disadvantages of Meteor, if you want another DB).
-	NodeJS is used for the server operations

# Running First Application:

-	Go to the terminal and type: meteor create firstapp
-	Meteor will install all the dependencies along with the package json files.
-	Move to the app folder using command: cd firstapp
-	Type: meteor run

This will run the application that runs on local host. On running this application, the local host link will be provided. Open that link in your browser. The default application of meteor opens.
